5/4/2017 - Thursday
- Make a plan for setting up Enigma I.

5/5/2017 - Friday
- Created interface called Rotor in order to require the Rotor classes to have their wiring and settings.
- RotorI, RotorII, RotorIII, RotorIV, RotorV classes created and implement Rotor interface.
- Added constructors to Rotors and the following methods:
	getTurnoverNotch(); getAlphabet(); getRotorWiring(); getConnection(String letter);

5/8/2017 - Monday
- Added the alphabet and specific rotor wirings each rotor.
- For classes RotorI - RotorV, getConnection(String letter) now works.
- Created class called Plugboard with methods:
	createPlugboard(); getAlphabet(); getPlugboard(); getPlugs(); getConnection();
- Created class called EnigmaI and started the constructor.

5/9/2017 - Tuesday
- Removed classes RotorII - RotorV and instead added a parameter that would create a rotor with specified wiring.

5/10/2017 - Wednesday
- Added class called Reflector which represents UKW-A, UKW-B, UKW-C
- Added ring setting parameter to Rotor.
- Changed all char variable types to Strings to avoid confusion and later consequences.
