5/4/2017 - Thursday (2 Periods)
- Make a plan for setting up Enigma I.

5/5/2017 - Friday (1 Period)
- Created interface called Rotor in order to require the Rotor classes to have their wiring and settings.
- RotorI, RotorII, RotorIII, RotorIV, RotorV classes created and implement Rotor interface.
- Added constructors to Rotors and the following methods:
	getTurnoverNotch(); getAlphabet(); getRotorWiring(); getConnection(String letter);

5/8/2017 - Monday (2 Periods)
- Added the alphabet and specific rotor wirings to each rotor.
- For classes RotorI - RotorV, getConnection(String letter) now works.
- Created class called Plugboard with methods:
	createPlugboard(); getAlphabet(); getPlugboard(); getPlugs(); getConnection();
- Created class called EnigmaI and started the constructor.

5/9/2017 - Tuesday (1 Period)
- Removed classes RotorII - RotorV and instead added a parameter that would create a rotor with specified wiring.

5/10/2017 - Wednesday (2 Periods)
- Created class called Reflector which represent reflectors UKW-A, UKW-B, UKW-C with methods:
	getAlphabet(); getReflectorWiring(); getConnection(String letter);
- Added ringSetting parameter to Rotor, as well as methods:
	getRingSetting(); setRingSetting(String letter); incrementRingSetting(); decrementRingSetting();
- Changed all char variable types to Strings to avoid confusion and later consequences.
- Started method encodeChar(String letter);
- Added method getPos(String letter) which returns the position of the letter in the alphabet to classes: 
	Rotor, Plugboard, and Reflector.
- Added method encodeLetter(String letter); to Rotor class, which converts the input letter to the letter at relative position 
of the rotor based on the ring setting, and then uses getConnection(String letter) to get the specific letter that's wired 
to the input letter.

5/11/2017 - Thursday (1 Period)
- Added Rotor stepping to encodeChar(); which uses the turnover notches to keep stepping each rotor.

5/12/2017 - Friday (2 Periods)
- Finished encodeChar();
- Debugging

5/15/2017 - Monday (1 Period)
- Debugging

5/16/2017 - Tuesday (2 Periods)
- Debugging (Almost done)
	Bug with taking in the relative position of letters from previous inputs.
